A [Micropub](http://micropub.net/) server plugin. Available in the WordPress plugin directory at [wordpress.org/plugins/micropub](https://wordpress.org/plugins/micropub/).


## Description 

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/snarfed/wordpress-micropub.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/snarfed/wordpress-micropub)

> Micropub is an open API standard that is used to create posts on one's own domain using third-party clients. Web apps and native apps (e.g. iPhone, Android) can use Micropub to post short notes, photos, events or other posts to your own site, similar to a Twitter client posting to Twitter.com.

Once you've installed and activated the plugin, try using [Quill](http://quill.p3k.io/) to create a new post on your site. It walks you through the steps and helps you troubleshoot if you run into any problems. After that, try other clients like [OwnYourGram](http://ownyourgram.com/), [OwnYourCheckin](https://ownyourcheckin.wirres.net/), [MobilePub](http://indiewebcamp.com/MobilePub), and [Teacup](https://teacup.p3k.io/).

Supports the [full W3C Micropub CR spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/) as of 2016-10-18, except for the optional media endpoint. Media may be uploaded directly to the wordpress-micropub endpoint as multipart/form-data, or sideloaded from URLs.

## WordPress details 


### Filters and hooks 
Adds four filters:

`before_micropub( $input )`

Called before handling a Micropub request. Returns `$input`, possibly modified.

`micropub_post_content( $post_content, $input )` 

Called during the handling of a Micropub request. The content generation function is attached to this filter by default. Returns `$post_content`, possibly modified.

`micropub_syndicate-to( $synd_urls, $user_id )`

Called to generate the list of `syndicate-to` targets to return in response to a query. Returns `$synd_urls`, an array, possibly modified.

`micropub_query( $resp, $input )`

$resp defaults to null. If the return value is non-null, it should be an associative array that is encoded as JSON and will be returned in place of the normal micropub response.

...and one hook:

`after_micropub( $input, $wp_args = null)`

Called after handling a Micropub request. Not called if the request fails (ie doesn't return HTTP 2xx).

Arguments:

* `$input`: associative array, the Micropub request in [JSON format](http://micropub.net/draft/index.html#json-syntax). If the request was form-encoded or a multipart file upload, it's converted to JSON format.
* `$wp_args`: optional associative array. For creates and updates, this is the arguments passed to `wp_insert_post` or `wp_update_post`. For deletes and undeletes, `args['ID']` contains the post id to be (un)deleted. Null for queries.


### Other 

Stores [microformats2](http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2) properties in [post metadata](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/post_meta_Function_Examples) with keys prefixed by `mf2_`. [Details here.](https://indiewebcamp.com/WordPress_Data#Microformats_data) All values are arrays; use `unserialize()` to deserialize them.

Does *not* support multithreading. PHP doesn't really either, so it generally won't matter, but just for the record.

Supports Experimental Properties for [Post Status](https://indieweb.org/Micropub-extensions#Post_Status) and [Visibility](https://indieweb.org/Micropub-extensions#Visibility). Visibility can be either
`public` or `private`. Setting it to `private` will set the post status to private. Post Status may be set to either `published` or `draft`. If visibility or post status are not set to one of these 
options, the plugin will return HTTP 400 with body:

    {
      "error": "invalid_request",
      "error_description": "Invalid Post Status"
    }

WordPress has a [whitelist of file extensions that it allows in uploads](https://codex.wordpress.org/Uploading_Files#About_Uploading_Files_on_Dashboard). If you upload a file in a Micropub extension that doesn't have an allowed extension, the plugin will return HTTP 400 with body:

    {
      "error": "invalid request",
      "error_description": "Sorry, this file is not permitted for security reasons."
    }



## Authentication and authorization 

Supports the full OAuth2/IndieAuth authentication and authorization flow. Defaults to IndieAuth. Custom auth and token endpoints can be used by overriding the `MICROPUB_AUTHENTICATION_ENDPOINT` and `MICROPUB_TOKEN_ENDPOINT` endpoints. If the token's `me` value matches a WordPress user's URL, that user will be used. Otherwise, the token must match the site's URL, and no user will be used.

Alternatively, you can set `MICROPUB_LOCAL_AUTH` to 1 to use WordPress's internal user login instead of tokens.

Finally, for ease of development, if the WordPress site is running on `localhost`, it logs a warning if the access token is missing or invalid and still allows the request.



## Installation 

Install from the WordPress plugin directory or put `micropub.php` in your plugin directory. No setup needed.



## Configuration Options 

These configuration options can be enabled by adding them to your wp-config.php

* `define('MICROPUB_LOCAL_AUTH', '1')` - Bypasses Micropub authentication in favor of WordPress authentication
* `define('MICROPUB_AUTHENTICATION_ENDPOINT', 'https://indieauth.com/auth')` - Define a custom authentication endpoint
* `define('MICROPUB_TOKEN_ENDPOINT', 'https://tokens.indieauth.com/token')` - Define a custom token endpoint


## Frequently Asked Questions 

If your Micropub client includes an `Authorization` HTTP request header but you still get an HTTP 401 response with body `missing access token`, your server may be stripping the `Authorization` header. If you're on Apache, [try adding this line to your `.htaccess` file](https://github.com/snarfed/wordpress-micropub/issues/56#issuecomment-299202820):

    SetEnvIf Authorization "(.*)" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1

If that doesn't work, [try this line](https://github.com/georgestephanis/application-passwords/wiki/Basic-Authorization-Header----Missing):

    RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]

If that doesn't work either, you may need to ask your hosting provider to whitelist the `Authorization` header for your account. If they refuse, you can [pass it through Apache with an alternate name](https://github.com/snarfed/wordpress-micropub/issues/56#issuecomment-299569822), but [you'll need to edit this plugin's code to read from that alternate name](https://github.com/snarfed/wordpress-micropub/issues/56#issuecomment-299569822).

## Development 

The canonical repo is http://github.com/snarfed/wordpress-micropub . Feedback and pull requests are welcome!

To add a new release to the WordPress plugin directory, run `push.sh`.

To set up your local environment to run the unit tests:

1. Install [PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit#installation), e.g. `brew install homebrew/php/wp-cli phpunit` with Homebrew on Mac OS X.
1. Install and start MySQL. (You may already have it.)
1. Run `./bin/install-wp-tests.sh wordpress_micropub_test root '' localhost` to download WordPress and [its unit test library](https://develop.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/tests/phpunit/), into `/tmp` and `./temp` by default, and create a MySQL db to test against. [Background here](http://wp-cli.org/docs/plugin-unit-tests/). Feel free to use a MySQL user other than `root`. You can set the `WP_CORE_DIR` and `WP_TESTS_DIR` environment variables to change where WordPress and its test library are installed. For example, I put them both in the repo dir.
1. Open `wordpress-tests-lib/wp-tests-config.php` and add a slash to the end of the ABSPATH value. No clue why it leaves off the slash; it doesn't work without it.
1. Run `phpunit` in the repo root dir. If you set `WP_CORE_DIR` and `WP_TESTS_DIR` above, you'll need to set them for this too. You should see output like this:

    ```
    Installing...
    ...
    1 / 1 (100%)
    Time: 703 ms, Memory: 33.75Mb
    OK (1 test, 3 assertions)
    ```

To set up PHPCodesniffer to test adherence to [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/php/) and [PHP 5.3 Compatibility](https://github.com/wimg/PHPCompatibility):

1. Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).
1. Run `composer install` which will install all dependencies for PHP Codesniffer and the standards required
1. To list coding standard issues in a file, run `phpcs --standard=phpcs.xml`
1. If you want to try to automatically fix issues, run `phpcbf` with the same arguments as `phpcs`.

To automatically convert the readme.txt file to readme.md, you may, if you have installed composer as noted in the previous section, enter `composer update-readme` to have the .txt file converted
into markdown and saved to readme.md.
