# wordpress-micropub

A [Micropub](http://micropub.net/) server plugin for [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/).

From [micropub.net](http://micropub.net/):

> Micropub is an open API standard that is used to create posts on one's own domain using third-party clients. Web apps and native apps (e.g. iPhone, Android) can use Micropub to post short notes, photos, events or other posts to your own site, similar to a Twitter client posting to Twitter.com.

Once you've installed and activated the plugin, try using
[Quill](http://quill.p3k.io/) to create a new post on your site. It walks you
through the steps and helps you troubleshoot if you run into any problems. After
that, try other clients like [OwnYourGram](http://ownyourgram.com/),
[MobilePub](http://indiewebcamp.com/MobilePub), and
[Teacup](https://teacup.p3k.io/).

Supports create, update, and delete, but not undelete. Supports optionally marking up these
Micropub properties:

* `category` maps to WordPress category if it exists, otherwise to WordPress tag
* `content`
* `description`
* `end`
* `h`=entry and `h`=event
* `in-reply-to`
* `like-of`/`like`
* `location` is stored in [WordPress standard geodata format](http://codex.wordpress.org/Geodata)
* `name`
* `photo`
* `published`
* `repost-of`/`repost`
* `rsvp`
* `slug`
* `start`
* `summary`
* `url`

Adds one WordPress filter, `before_micropub($wp_args)`, and one hook,
`after_micropub($post_id)`.

Delegates token handling to
[tokens.indieauth.com](https://tokens.indieauth.com/). If the token's `me` value
matches a WordPress user's URL, that user will be used. Otherwise, the token
must match the site's URL, and no user will be used.

For ease of development, if the WordPress site is running on `localhost`, it
logs a warning if the access token is missing or invalid and still allows the
request.

Stores [microformats2](http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2) properties in
[post metadata](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/post_meta_Function_Examples)
with keys prefixed by `mf2_`.
