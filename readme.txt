A [Micropub](http://micropub.net/) server plugin. Available in the WordPress plugin directory at [wordpress.org/plugins/micropub](https://wordpress.org/plugins/micropub/).

== Description ==

[![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/indieweb/wordpress-micropub.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/indieweb/wordpress-micropub)

> Micropub is an open API standard that is used to create posts on one's own domain using third-party clients. Web apps and native apps (e.g. iPhone, Android) can use Micropub to post short notes, photos, events or other posts to your own site, similar to a Twitter client posting to Twitter.com.

Once you've installed and activated the plugin, try using [Quill](http://quill.p3k.io/) to create a new post on your site. It walks you through the steps and helps you troubleshoot if you run into any problems. A list of known Micropub clients are available [here](https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Clients)

Supports the [full W3C Micropub CR spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/) as of version 2.0.0.

== License ==

This project is placed in the public domain. You may also use it under the [CC0 license](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

== Scope ==

Supports the following [scope](https://indieweb.org/scope) parameters requested by Micropub clients.
* post (legacy) - Grants all user delegated access
* create - Allows the client to create posts on behalf of the user
* update - Allows the client to update posts on behalf of the user
* delete - Allows the client to delete posts on behalf of the user
* undelete - Allows the client to undelete posts on behalf of the user
* media  - Supports media for the media endpoint, but create or update also give media upload permissions

== WordPress details ==

= Filters and hooks =
Adds six filters:

`before_micropub( $input )`

Called before handling a Micropub request. Returns `$input`, possibly modified.

`micropub_post_content( $post_content, $input )` 

Called during the handling of a Micropub request. The content generation function is attached to this filter by default. Returns `$post_content`, possibly modified.

`micropub_syndicate-to( $synd_urls, $user_id )`

Called to generate the list of `syndicate-to` targets to return in response to a query. Returns `$synd_urls`, an array, possibly modified. This filter is empty by default
`micropub_query( $resp, $input )`

$resp defaults to null. If the return value is non-null, it should be an associative array that is encoded as JSON and will be returned in place of the normal micropub response.

`indieauth_scopes( $scopes )`

This returns scopes from a plugin implementing IndieAuth or from the internal IndieAuth code. This filter is empty by default.

`indieauth_response( $response )`

This returns the token auth response from a plugin implementing IndieAuth or from the internal IndieAuth code. This filter is empty by default.

...and two hooks:

`after_micropub( $input, $wp_args = null)`

Called after handling a Micropub request. Not called if the request fails (ie doesn't return HTTP 2xx).

`micropub_syndication( $ID, $syndicate_to )`


Called only if there are syndication targets $syndicate_to for post $ID. $syndicate_to will be an array of UIDs that are verified as one or more of the UIDs added using the `micropub_syndicate-to` filter.

Arguments:

* `$input`: associative array, the Micropub request in [JSON format](http://micropub.net/draft/index.html#json-syntax). If the request was form-encoded or a multipart file upload, it's converted to JSON format.
* `$wp_args`: optional associative array. For creates and updates, this is the arguments passed to `wp_insert_post` or `wp_update_post`. For deletes and undeletes, `args['ID']` contains the post id to be (un)deleted. Null for queries.

= Other =

Stores [microformats2](http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2) properties in [post metadata](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/post_meta_Function_Examples) with keys prefixed by `mf2_`. [Details here.](https://indiewebcamp.com/WordPress_Data#Microformats_data) All values are arrays; use `unserialize()` to deserialize them.

Does *not* support multithreading. PHP doesn't really either, so it generally won't matter, but just for the record.

Supports Experimental Properties:
* [Post Status](https://indieweb.org/Micropub-extensions#Post_Status) - Either `published` or `draft`
* [Visibility](https://indieweb.org/Micropub-extensions#Visibility) - Either `public` or `private`.
* [Location Visiblity](https://indieweb.org/Micropub-extensions#Location_Visibility) - Either `public`, `private`, or `protected`

If an experimental property is not set to one of these options, the plugin will return HTTP 400 with body:

    {
      "error": "invalid_request",
    }

WordPress has a [whitelist of file extensions that it allows in uploads](https://codex.wordpress.org/Uploading_Files#About_Uploading_Files_on_Dashboard). If you upload a file in a Micropub extension that doesn't have an allowed extension, the plugin will return HTTP 400 with body:

    {
      "error": "invalid_request",
      "error_description": "Sorry, this file is not permitted for security reasons."
    }


== Authentication and authorization ==

For reasons of security it is recommended that you only use this plugin on sites that implement HTTPS.

Supports the full OAuth2/IndieAuth authentication and authorization flow. Defaults to IndieAuth.com. Custom auth and token endpoints can be used by overriding the `MICROPUB_AUTHENTICATION_ENDPOINT`
and `MICROPUB_TOKEN_ENDPOINT` endpoints or by setting the options `indieauth_authorization_endpoint` and `indieauth_token_endpoint`.

If you want to use your own site as an IndieAuth endpoint, you can activate the IndieAuth plugin which is recommended but not required. You can disable the authentication in favor of an alternative plugin.
This can be done by removing the loading of the auth flow or setting MICROPUB_LOCAL_AUTH to 1.

`remove_action( 'plugins_loaded', 'load_micropub_auth', 20 );` 

If the token's `me` value matches a WordPress user's or author post URL, that user will be used. If there is only one site author that will be matched otherwise.

== Installation ==

Install from the WordPress plugin directory. No setup needed.


== Configuration Options ==

These configuration options can be enabled by adding them to your wp-config.php

* `define('MICROPUB_AUTHENTICATION_ENDPOINT', 'https://indieauth.com/auth')` - Define a custom authentication endpoint.
* `define('MICROPUB_TOKEN_ENDPOINT', 'https://tokens.indieauth.com/token')` - Define a custom token endpoint
* `define('MICROPUB_NAMESPACE', 'micropub/1.0' )` - By default the namespace for micropub is micropub/1.0. This would allow you to change this for your endpoint
* `define('MICROPUB_DISABLE_NAG', 1 ) - Disable notices for insecure sites
* `define('MICROPUB_LOCAL_AUTH', 1 ) - Disable built in AUTH in favor of your own plugin. Recommend plugin developers use the filter `disable_micropub_auth` for this.

These configuration options can be enabled by setting them in the WordPress options table.
* `indieauth_authorization_endpoint` - if set will override MICROPUB_AUTHENTICATION_ENDPOINT for setting a custom endpoint
* `indieauth_token_endpoint` - if set will override MICROPUB_TOKEN_ENDPOINT for setting a custom endpoint
* `micropub_default_post_status` - if set, Micropub posts will be set to this status by default( publish, draft, or private ). Can also be set on the settings page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

If your Micropub client includes an `Authorization` HTTP request header but you still get an HTTP 401 response with body `missing access token`, your server may be stripping the `Authorization` header. If you're on Apache, [try adding this line to your `.htaccess` file](https://github.com/indieweb/wordpress-micropub/issues/56#issuecomment-299202820):

    SetEnvIf Authorization "(.*)" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1

If that doesn't work, [try this line](https://github.com/georgestephanis/application-passwords/wiki/Basic-Authorization-Header----Missing):

    RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]

If that doesn't work either, you may need to ask your hosting provider to whitelist the `Authorization` header for your account. If they refuse, you can [pass it through Apache with an alternate name](https://github.com/indieweb/wordpress-micropub/issues/56#issuecomment-299569822). The plugin searches for the header in REDIRECT_HTTP_AUTHORIZATION, as some FastCGI implementations store the header in this location.

If you are getting an `Unauthorized` error despite passing a valid access token then your WordPress installation may not be able to match your user account with the provided URL. The easiest way to 
resolve is to add the URL you are using as the URL in your user profile. 

== Upgrade Notice ==

= Version 2.0.0 =

This version changes the Micropub endpoint URL as it now uses the REST API. You may have to update any third-parties that have cached this info.

== Screenshots ==

None.

== Development ==

The canonical repo is http://github.com/indieweb/wordpress-micropub . Feedback and pull requests are welcome!

To add a new release to the WordPress plugin directory, run `push.sh`.

To set up your local environment to run the unit tests and set up PHPCodesniffer to test adherence to [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/php/) and [PHP 5.3 Compatibility](https://github.com/wimg/PHPCompatibility):

1. Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org). Composer is only used for development and is not required to run the plugin.
1. Run `composer install` which will install PHP Codesniffer, PHPUnit, the standards required, and all dependencies.

To configure PHPUnit

1. Install and start MySQL. (You may already have it.)
1. Run `./bin/install-wp-tests.sh wordpress_micropub_test root '' localhost` to download WordPress and [its unit test library](https://develop.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/tests/phpunit/), into `/tmp` and `./temp` by default, and create a MySQL db to test against. [Background here](http://wp-cli.org/docs/plugin-unit-tests/). Feel free to use a MySQL user other than `root`. You can set the `WP_CORE_DIR` and `WP_TESTS_DIR` environment variables to change where WordPress and its test library are installed. For example, I put them both in the repo dir.
1. Open `wordpress-tests-lib/wp-tests-config.php` and add a slash to the end of the ABSPATH value. No clue why it leaves off the slash; it doesn't work without it.
1. Run `phpunit` in the repo root dir. If you set `WP_CORE_DIR` and `WP_TESTS_DIR` above, you'll need to set them for this too. You should see output like this:

    ```
    Installing...
    ...
    1 / 1 (100%)
    Time: 703 ms, Memory: 33.75Mb
    OK (1 test, 3 assertions)
    ```

To set up PHPCodesniffer to test adherence to [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/php/) and [PHP 5.3 Compatibility](https://github.com/wimg/PHPCompatibility):

1. To list coding standard issues in a file, run `phpcs --standard=phpcs.xml`
1. If you want to try to automatically fix issues, run `phpcbf` with the same arguments as `phpcs`.

To automatically convert the readme.txt file to readme.md, you may, if you have installed composer as noted in the previous section, enter `composer update-readme` to have the .txt file converted
into markdown and saved to readme.md.
